## [Car Insurance](https://github.com/jeremydelain/C-Sharp_Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance) 

  This project is an MVC web application that simulates a rudimentary car insurnance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.
